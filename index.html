                        <h3 class='boxed'> Providing food, vaccinations, bedding, and enrichment needs for dogs is a costly endeavor for animal shelters across the country. Due to the high cost of these basic necessities, shelters often have to limit the number of dogs that they can save and provide homes for. A warm bed and a full belly can go a long way for the well-being of shelter dogs and puppies. Through proper vaccination, animals' risk of disease is cut down or eliminated, leaving shelter volunteers more time to find good homes for these dogs. Animals that are healthy, happy, and well fed stand a much better chance of being adopted.</h3>
